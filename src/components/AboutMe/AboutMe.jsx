				<h1>Hey, I'm Ghaz!</h1>
				<p>
					I'm a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with over 2 years of
					professional experience and 14+ years as a hobbyist. My love for
					technology started in middle school when I accidentally broke my first
					laptop. I delved into its components, I discovered a fascination for
					hardware. However, I later found my true passion in software
					development and fell in love with it!
				</p>
				<p>
					Back in secondary school (at the age of 13), I founded a Computer Club
					and introduced programming to my friends and classmates. It was an
					exciting opportunity to share my enthusiasm for technology with
					others.
				</p>
				<p>
					Apart from my technical pursuits, I have a diverse range of interests:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						I love hiking and even conquered Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in
						the British Isles!
					</li>
					<li>
						I am multilingual and can speak 4 languages:
						<ul>
							<li>ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English (native)</li> <li>ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Indonesian (native)</li>
							<li>ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Italian (professional proficiency)</li>
							<li>ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French (professional proficiency)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						I am an avid cook and enjoy exploring cuisines from around the
						world. I've delved into Asian, British, and Italian dishes, and I'm
						currently venturing into Eastern European flavors!
					</li>
				</ul>
