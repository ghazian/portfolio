        <h1>Hey I'm Ghaz!</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a<strong> Software Engineer</strong>, professional SE for 2+ years
          and a hobbiest for 14+ years! I've grown my love for tech since middle
          school when I broke my very first laptop... I looked into the
          components and that got me into hardware, but later discovered the
          software side and fell in love with it! I've made a Computer Club way
          back in secondary education (age 13) and got people including my
          friends into programming!
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from that, I love hiking (beat Ben Nevis!), I can speak 4
          languages, ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English and ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Indonesian as a native language and ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹
          Italian and ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· France as a professional literacy. I'm also an avid
          cook! I love cooking dishes from around the world, I've explored
          Asian, British, and Italian cuisines, and currently exploring Eastern
          European!
